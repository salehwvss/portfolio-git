It has been designed and developed via “UNITY” game engine in C# language.
            The game targets youngster between age 6-40 years old. I have developed this game in summer 2016 during my free time. The game is very unique in terms of design. It’s got 3D visual effects to enhance game experience. The main goal of this game is to entertain people. The main reason that I created this game was to get familiarize to unity interface. The game has 21 unique levels. What make this game apart from other games is its gorgeous design, special 3D effects, diverse elements that affects gameplay and implementation of leader board which allows players to compete with one another. <br><br><br>

            <h6 class="textstyle-challenge" id="p2-h6">I faced several challenges from design to programming. Since I did not have a lot of game design experience in unity, I had to watch a lot of tutorials (thanks to Google, Youtube and Udemy). I spent countless hours understanding Unity interface and its tools. Another challenge was creating google developer account in order to submit my game to google playstore. In addition to that, I needed to implement ads to the game to see the game potential. There were multiple ad companies such as Unity and Google. I decided to learn how to implement both Unity and Google ads. I faced more challenges when I got near the end of the project. During development phase I was testing my game on my personal laptop, however when I tested it on mobile phones I realize the difference in performance.

              <h6 class="textstyle-overcoming" id="p2-h6">The major challenge was to learn how to program in Unity Engine. I overcame this challenge by spending lots of time purchasing and watching different tutorials available online. During development I noticed that I also need to enhance my JavaScript skills. Since Unity supports JavaScript, knowing JavaScript language could make the development process faster. When I started the project, I did not know that I need to optimize my game performance, therefore, I ended up creating a slow game that could be played only on flagship devices with high graphic cards such as Samsung Galaxy S7. Lastly, I got introduced to “Object Pooling” in unity. This technique let us reuse objects without destroying them. I was able to optimize my game using this technique. <br></h6>
