The game world aesthetics takes the players to a childish world where they can enjoy guiding Kobe through obstacles and dangerous items in the game world. The game world also challenges the player in various ways, encouraging them to play more. This is due to the nature of platformer games where the player enjoys passing time by running, jumping and avoiding obstacles in the game play. <br>
          <span style="font-weight:bold">Plot: </span> Dr. Jelly is an alien scientist who is on a mission to collect babies from the earth for his scientific research. On his first mission, he needs to capture Kobe; but, getting his hands on Kobe is not as easy as he thinks….<br>
          <span style="font-weight:bold">Target audience: </span> Suitable for all age groups (kids to adults). The audience of this game are casual gamers who play games for passing time.<br>
          <span style="font-weight:bold">Objective: </span> The game has been developed to please the user and improve player’s decision-making skill by letting the player choose between best provided options in order to survive.<br>
          <span style="font-weight:bold">Team members: </span> This project has been created by a team of four.<br>
          <span style="font-weight:bold">Core loop: </span> The core loop of this game is running, avoiding obstacle and collecting rewards (candies, jellies, cotton candies).<br>

            <h6 class="textstyle-challenge" id="p-h6">As a team, each of us encountered different problems from
                visuals to coding. For me the most difficult part of the game
                logic was the artificial intelligence of the characters specially
                the Dr.Jelly, because he had to do some moves on his own,
                for example he had to avoid obstacles, and throws objects at
                Kobe. We also encountered other challenges like optimizing our game for different platforms including IOS and Androi to get the best performance. <br><br><br>

              <h6 class="textstyle-overcoming" id="p-h6">During project process and development we faced several challenges including time constraints and different member’s opinion upon certain elements of the game. Since we were four persons in the team we needed a group leader to guide us through the project. We assigned the group leader in the second week of the project. We were able to manage our time by sticking to the assigned weekly schedule. I focused on AI of the game for several days, because without an AI the movement and animation of the Dr. Jelly would be repetitive and not aesthetically pleasing. I achieved a fairy simple AI using logics such as if and switch statements. </h6>
